- Entity:remove() and Entity:rawremove() do not demodify bitwise component mask.
Fix is to do bitwise not on individual mask of component, and bit.band the result with the entity mask to remove that component's bit.

This really needs fixing!!!




- Make Cyan automatically convert to non-bitop mode when it runs out of integer bits instead of raising error.




- Try harder to find a way to do bitops with C longs
