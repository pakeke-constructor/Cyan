- Entity:remove() and Entity:rawremove() do not demodify bitwise component mask.
Fix is to do bitwise-not on individual mask of component, and bit.band the result with the entity mask to remove that component's bit.

This really needs fixing!!!



- NOT A BUG ::
- Make Cyan automatically convert to non-bitop mode when it runs out of integer bits instead of raising error.



- NOT A BUG ::
- Try harder to find a way to do bitops with C longs



- NOT A BUG ::
- For cyan flushing, only remove entities from systems that actually take entities.
- This way it is impossible for static systems to cause overhead
