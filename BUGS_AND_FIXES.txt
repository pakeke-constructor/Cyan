- NOT A BUG ::
- Make Cyan automatically convert to non-bitop mode when it runs out of integer bits instead of raising error.

- Split bitmask for ent components into 2 lua integers, to double the number of sys comps available to user.
NOTE::: Be super careful when shifting with this setup! Test test test!!!!!!!
